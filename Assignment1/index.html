            <h2>Custom Data</h2>
            <p>Electric cars use rechargeable batteries and require no engine oil, reducing maintenance costs. Diesel cars provide better mileage and longevity but emit more nitrogen oxides. Petrol cars offer quicker acceleration and are widely available but have higher fuel costs. CNG cars produce fewer emissions and extend engine life but require specialized storage tanks. Hybrid cars intelligently switch between fuel and electric power for efficiency. Hydrogen cars generate electricity using fuel cells, emitting only water, but their adoption is limited due to high costs and infrastructure challenges.</p>

                <img src="fortuner.jpg" alt="Image 2">
                <p>A diesel car runs on diesel fuel and uses a compression ignition engine. It offers better fuel efficiency and torque, making it ideal for long-distance travel. However, it emits more pollutants compared to electric or petrol cars.</p>

                <h3>CNG+PETROL CAR</h3>
                <img src="wagoanr.jpg" alt="Image 3">
                <p>A CNG car runs on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as fuel, offering a cleaner and more affordable alternative to petrol and diesel. It produces lower emissions, reduces fuel costs, and is environmentally friendly. However, it has a lower driving range and requires a CNG refueling station.</p>
